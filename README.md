### [Gameroom]

The Gameroom page is the central interface for gameplay, displaying essential player information (name, avatar, readiness, round status, and score) on the left, based the current round. The top section features room details (name and theme) alongside a volume control for audio adjustments. On the right, a timer counts down each round, complemented by widgets showing current round details and reminders. The bottom-right contains audio recorders supporting recording, playing and reversing, an answer input field, and buttons for uploading/sharing and confirming answer validation. Before and after the game, the bottom-right area will have only the confirm ready pop up or the ranked leader board pop up showing the final result.

### [Lobby]

The lobby page serves as a navigation hub to various parts of the site. In the top-left, user information (avatar and name) is displayed; clicking here allows access to profile editing. The bottom-left features a logout button, redirecting users to the login/register page. Near the center, an animated info button activates a pop-up with game rules and buttons to activate mic and redirect to the rule guide page. On the right, a list of game rooms shows real-time details (current status, available seats, players, room theme, and name), each clickable to join a game directly from the lobby.

## Prerequisites & Installation

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.\
We urge you to install the exact version **v22.10.0** which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.10.0/).\
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

- **MacOS:** [node-v22.10.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.10.0/node-v22.10.0.pkg)
- **Windows 32-bit:** [node-v22.10.0-x86.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.10.0/node-v22.10.0-x86.msi)
- **Windows 64-bit:** [node-v22.10.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.10.0/node-v22.10.0-x64.msi)
- **Linux:** [node-v22.10.0.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.10.0/node-v22.10.0-linux-x64.tar.xz) (use this [installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux) if you are new to Linux)

If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

- **Homebrew:**¬†`brew install node@v22.10.0`
- **Chocolatey:**¬†`choco install nodejs-lts --version=v22.10.0`

After the installation, update the npm package manager to **10.9.0** by running ```npm install -g npm@10.9.0```\
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running ```node -v``` and ```npm --version```, which should give you **v22.10.0** and **10.9.0** respectively.\
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

```npm install```

Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).\
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.

```npm run lint```

Automatically check an format your code following predefined ESlint rules.


### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:\
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
